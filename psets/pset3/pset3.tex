%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 1
\section*{Problem 1}
\textbf{b} is the correct answer.

\noindent We want the probability bound $2Me^{2\epsilon^2N}$ to be at most $.03$.
So, we can solve for
\[ 2Me^{-2\epsilon^2N} = .03 \]
\[ 2e^{-2(.05)^2N} = .03 \]
\[ e^{-2(.05)^2N} = .015 \]
\[ N = 839.94 \]
So for any $N$ less than this value, our probability bound will be greater
than $.03$. So the answer is $1000$. We can check this by plugging in
$500$ and $1000$ into $2Me^{2\epsilon^2N}$. At $500$, we get $.164$, which is
too big. At $1000$, we get $.013$, which is below the desired bound. Thus
$1000$ is the correct answer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 2
\section*{Problem 2}
\textbf{c} is the correct answer.

\noindent We want the probability bound $2Me^{2\epsilon^2N}$ to be at most $.03$.
So, we can solve for
\[ 2Me^{-2\epsilon^2N} = .03 \]
\[ 20e^{-2(.05)^2N} = .03 \]
\[ e^{-2(.05)^2N} = .0015 \]
\[ N = 1300.46 \]
So for any $N$ less than this value, our probability bound will be greater
than $.03$. So the answer is $1500$. We can check this by plugging in
$1000$ and $1500$ into $2Me^{2\epsilon^2N}$. At $1000$, we get $.135$, which is
too big. At $1500$, we get $.011$, which is below the desired bound. Thus
$1500$ is the correct answer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3
\section*{Problem 3}
\textbf{d} is the correct answer.

\noindent We want the probability bound $2Me^{2\epsilon^2N}$ to be at most $.03$.
So, we can solve for
\[ 2Me^{-2\epsilon^2N} = .03 \]
\[ 200e^{-2(.05)^2N} = .03 \]
\[ e^{-2(.05)^2N} = .00015 \]
\[ N = 1760.98 \]
So for any $N$ less than this value, our probability bound will be greater
than $.03$. So the answer is $2000$. We can check this by plugging in
$1500$ and $2000$ into $2Me^{2\epsilon^2N}$. At $1500$, we get $.111$, which is
too big. At $2000$, we get $.009$, which is below the desired bound. Thus
$2000$ is the correct answer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 4
\section*{Problem 4}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 5
\section*{Problem 5}
\textbf{b} is the correct answer.

\noindent We have that if there is no break point, $m_{\mathcal{H}}(N) = 2^N$,
and that if there is any break point, $m_{\mathcal{H}}(N)$ is polynomial in $N$.
So, we know that (i) and (ii) are actual growth functions, since they are
the growth functions for positive rays and positive intervals and are of the
form $\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\binom{N}{i}$. And we have that (v) is just $2^N$. Then
we have that (iii) and (iv) are not polynomial in $N$ and not $2^N$. So we have
our answer.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 6
\section*{Problem 6}
\textbf{c} is the correct answer.

\noindent We have that with the "2-invervals" learning model, we can have at
most 2 distinct sets of positive points. This is enough to shatter 3 and 4 points,
as it is impossible to have 3 distinct sets of positive points with just
3 or 4 points. But with 5 points, it is possible to have this: +1, -1, +1, -1,
+1, and we cannot achieve this dichotomy with the "2-intervals" learning
model. So the answer is 5.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 7
\section*{Problem 7}
\textbf{c} is the correct answer.

\noindent We get to this answer the following way. There are $\binom{N+1}{4}$
ways to place 2 distinct intervals (choosing 4 bounds in total),
and $\binom{N+1}{2}$ ways to place 1 distinct inverval (choosing 2 bounds in
total). Then there is just $1$ dichotomy in which all the intervals are placed
such that all the points are negative.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 8
\section*{Problem 8}
\textbf{d} is the correct answer.

\noindent \textbf{d} is the only option that is consistent with the "1-interval"
and "2-interval" learning models - for the "1-interval" learning model we had
a break point of 3, and for the "2-interval" learning model we had a break point
of 5. This also makes sense in general, as given $M$ intervals to play with,
we can have at most $M$ distinct sets of positive points. So we are going to break
once we reach $2M + 1$ points, because at this point we can have $M+1$ distinct
sets of positive points as a possible dichotomy.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 9
\section*{Problem 9}
\textbf{c} is the correct answer.

\noindent 1 point can clearly be shattered. 3 points can also clearly be
shattered because a triangle is more powerful than a line. If we arrange all
the points in a circle, it is clear that 5 points can be shattered as well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 10
\section*{Problem 10}
\textbf{b} is the correct answer.

\noindent Here, the maximum number of dichotomies we can get on $N$ points
is when we put the $N$ points on a line. When we do this, the concentric circles
act as intervals, and we can then see that this problem breaks down to
the single positive interval problem. Thus our growth function for this is
the same as our growth function for the single positive interval problem,
$\binom{N+1}{2} + 1$.
